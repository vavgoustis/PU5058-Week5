```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

This guide is partly based on online material from Amy Willis, Kiirsti
Owen and Amelia McNamara, and the book "R for Data Science" by Hadley
Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. Thank you amazing R community!

### R as a calculator

In the Console window below, type: 2+2 and press Enter Also try:

```{r}
2^5
3/10
(3+5)^2
sqrt(4)
```

Tip: To run a line (or multiple lines) of code from a script without
typing them into the Console, select the line(s) you want to run and
press Ctrl+Enter (Command+Enter on a Mac)

### Objects

R stores data as objects. You create new objects when you assign a value
to them using "\<-":

```{r}
x <- 3  # Check the "Environment" window!
```

Tip: use the R studio shortcut Alt+ - (Alt and the minus sign) to easily
create the assignment symbol \<-

```{r}
y <- 6
x+y
```

Tip: R is case sensitive so if you've defined your object as x, it will
not recognise (capital) X. Similarly, the function for square root is
sqrt, R will give you an error if you try to use Sqrt.

### Packages

Packages extend the functionality of base R. They are distributed via
CRAN: the Comprehensive R Archive Network

To install a package, use: install.packages("packagename") You then need
to load it, using library(packagename)

We will be using a collection of packages called the Tidyverse:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

When you load the tidyverse, you'll see a message about conflicts. As
there is an (increasingly) large number of packages in R, it is possible
to have functions with the same name in more than one package. The
message tells you that packages dplyr and stats both have a function
called filter and the one that will be used is the one from dplyr. It is
the one that was loaded last.

If you want to use a function from a particular package, you need to
include packagename:: before the name of the function.

In this example, you can use stats::filter() instead of just filter() to
use filter from the stats package.

```{r}
find("filter") # this shows you the packages a function belongs to, in order of priority
```

The tidyverse packages we will be using mostly in this course are readr
(for reading in data), dplyr (for transforming data) and ggplot2 (for
plotting).

### Functions

When using the Tidyverse, you can call functions in two ways:

```{r}
sqrt(4) # base R

4 %>%
  sqrt  # "pipe" operator (you can read is as "and then...")
```

Tip: use the R Studio shortcut Ctrl + Sft + M to create the pipe
operator %\>%

Tip: If you are not sure what a function does, type ?functionname in the
Console, e.g. ?sqrt

### Reading in data

Before we read in our data, let's consider where we have saved our data
file. Since we want our code to be reusable (by us and other people),
the last thing we want is to include the location of the file in our
code, something like:

"C:/dimitra/data/datafile.csv"

The above would only work for me, and only for the particular computer
where folder "dimitra" contains a folder called "data".

To avoid these issues, we need to do two things:

1.  Use R projects. (I hope you are doing that already!) Save the data
    and R markdown file inside the R project. Exactly where you save
    your code doesn't matter, you just need to note the location of your
    data with respect to the .Rproj file.
2.  Use the R package "here". "Here" points to the location of the
    .Rproj file (which is the working directory for your project), so
    you just need to add "here" in front of the relative path to your
    data file.

For example, if your data file (a comma-separated value (csv) file) was
saved inside a "data" directory, you would say:

library(here)

fev_data \<- read_csv(here("data/fev.csv"))

To read in a file that is saved in the same directory as the .Rproj
file:

```{r here, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, include=FALSE}
library(here)
# Include = False because otherwise my personal innformation would show...
```

```{r fev}
fev_data <- read_csv(here("01_Input/fev.csv"))
 fev_data
```

(Remember to install the "here" package the first time.)

--\> How would you use read_csv with the pipe operator?

```{r warning=FALSE}
# This was a very weird "no, no, no, YES!" trial-and-error process.

fev_data <-
"01_Input/fev.csv" %>% here() %>% read_csv()
```

Look at the top few rows of the data:

```{r}
head(fev_data)
```

fev_data is a tibble - this is a tidyverse structure similar to a data
frame (from base R) but with some differences:

-   default printing is shorter
-   tells you the column types (character, double, etc.)
-   doesn't change the types of inputs

Tip: if your data is in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, you will need a
different package to read it in, such as readxl. So you'll need:

install.packages("readxl")

library(readxl)

excel_data \<- read_xlsx(filename, sheet = 1) \#(to read the first
sheet)

--\> How would you read in a text file? (Check the data import cheat
sheet!) There is a text file in your dataset so you can practice:
psa.txt

```{r}
psa_data <-
  "01_Input/psa.txt" %>% here() %>% read_table()
```

--\> Have a look at the "Useful arguments" section of the data import
cheat sheet. Use a few of them when you read in fev.csv and look at the
data, is that what you expected?

```{r}
# Yes it works as expected.
read_csv(here("01_Input/fev.csv"), col_select = c(subjid, age, height))
```

--\> Apply the summary function to a tibble. What does it do?

```{r}
# It displays statistically notable facts about the values in every column of data.
summary(fev_data)
summary(psa_data)
```

### Operating on data: columns

Individual columns are identified using the \$ symbol:

```{r}
head(fev_data$fev)
summary(fev_data$fev)
length(fev_data$fev)
```

Other useful functions for tibbles and data frames:

```{r}
names(fev_data)
dim(fev_data)
```

Other useful functions for columns:

```{r}
max(fev_data$fev)
mean(fev_data$fev)
sd(fev_data$fev)
```
